This is a website develop using django framework for a real state of São Lourenço do Oeste - Santa Catarina - Brasil

The ideia of this website it's to show the customers of this company the properties that this real state is selling or renting, furthermore, to facilitate for the admin of the company to insert new properties, edit and delete those that he wants

For the front-end I've imported a template that I think have a good look and I edit the backend as my way.
